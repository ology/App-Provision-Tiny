=head1 NAME

Acme::Opish - Prefix the audible vowels of words

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Acme::Opish;

  print enop('Hello Aeryk!');
  # Hopellopo Opaeropyk! 

  @opped = enop('five', 'yellow', '/literature/Wuthering_Heights.txt');
  # fopive, yopellopow, /literature/opish-Wuthering_Heights.txt

  @opped = enop('xe', 'ze'));       # xe, ze
  @words = no_silent_e('xe', 'ze');
  @opped = enop('xe', 'ze');        # xope, zope
  @words = has_silent_e('xe', 'ze');
  @opped = enop('xe', 'ze');        # xe, ze

  # Okay.  Why not add anything you want, instead of "op"?
  print enop(-opish_prefix => 'ubb', 'Foo bar?');
  # Fubboo bubbar?

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Convert words to Opish, which is similar to "Ubish", but infinitely 
cooler.

More accurately, this means, add an arbitrary prefix to the vowel 
groups of words, except for the "silent e" and "starting, non-vowel 
y's".

Note: This module capitalizes words like you would expect.  Maybe a 
couple examples will elucidate this point:

  enop('Abc') produces 'Opabc'
  enop('abC') produces 'opabC'

Unfortunately, this function, currently converts consecutive spaces 
and newlines into single spaces and newlines.  Yes, this is not a 
feature, but a bug.

* See the eg/ directory for examples.

=head1 EXPORT

=head2 enop [-opish_prefix => STRING,] ARRAY

Convert strings or entire text files to opish.

If a member of the given array is a string, it is converted to opish.
If it is an existing text file, it is opened and converted to opish, 
and then saved as "opish-$filename".

If the first member of the argument list is "-opish_prefix", then the 
next argument is assumed to be the user defined prefix to use in 
place of "op".

=head2 no_silent_e ARRAY

Add the given arguments to the list of words that are to be 
converted without regard for the "silent e".

This function returns the keys in the "not silent e" list.

=head2 has_silent_e ARRAY

Delete the given arguments from the list of words that are to be
converted with regard for the "silent e".

This function returns the keys in the "not silent e" list.

=head1 TO DO

Make this thing preserve contiguous whitespace.

Go in reverse.  That is "deop" text.

Add more "non-silent-e" words to the "OK" list.
